# Ralph — Autonomous AI Worker System

## Overview

Ralph is an autonomous dispatcher/worker system that processes GitHub Issues using Claude Code agents running in GitHub Actions. It follows Matt Pocock's dispatcher/worker architecture from his [course-video-manager](https://github.com/mattpocock/course-video-manager) project.

**Flow:** You create issues (manually or via Claude Code skills during work sessions) → label them `ralph` → run `pnpm dispatch` → dispatcher (Sonnet) reads issues, builds dependency graph, selects actionable tasks → dispatches parallel GitHub Actions workflows → workers (Opus) implement features on `claude/*` branches → workers open PRs → you review and merge.

## Architecture

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Task source | GitHub Issues (posted by skills or manually) |
| Queue gating | `ralph` label required on issues |
| Issue format | GitHub Issue Template with Classification, Blocked by, Acceptance criteria |
| Dependencies | "Blocked by #N" in issue body; dispatcher checks if those issues are closed |
| Priority | Labels: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low` |
| Issue classification | `AFK` (autonomous) or `HITL` (needs human) in issue body + as labels |
| Architecture | Dispatcher/worker on GitHub Actions (not local loop) |
| Dispatch trigger | Manual only (`pnpm dispatch`) — never triggered by Claude |
| Dispatch model | Sonnet (reasoning/classification only) |
| Worker model | Opus (code generation) |
| Worker permissions | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (ephemeral CI runner, safe) |
| Branch naming | `claude/<short-slug>-<unix-timestamp>` |
| Commit convention | `RALPH:` prefix with description and issue reference |
| PR behavior | Opened when work is complete; `Closes #N` for auto-close on merge |
| Quality gates (before commit) | `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test:unit --run` |
| Auth in CI | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` via Anthropic GitHub App |
| CLAUDE.md | Amended git rule for worker exception; added "never dispatch" rule |

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/dispatch.sh` | Local orchestrator — fetches issues, calls Sonnet, dispatches Actions workflows |
| `scripts/dispatch-prompt.md` | Prompt for the Sonnet dispatcher — classification, dependency graph, conflict detection |
| `scripts/worker-run.sh` | Worker script — creates branch, fetches issue context, runs Opus, commits, outputs PR metadata |
| `scripts/worker-prompt.md` | Prompt for the Opus worker — explore, implement, quality gates, commit, PR output |
| `.github/workflows/claude-work.yml` | Actions workflow — triggered by dispatch, sets up env, runs worker, pushes, creates PR |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ralph-task.yml` | Issue template — Description, Classification, Blocked by, Acceptance criteria |

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added Ralph worker git exception; added "never dispatch Ralph" rule |
| `package.json` | Added `"dispatch": "./scripts/dispatch.sh"` script |

## Labels Created

- `ralph` — Issue is ready for Ralph to pick up
- `priority:high` — High priority (red)
- `priority:medium` — Medium priority (yellow)
- `priority:low` — Low priority (green)
- `AFK` — Can be implemented autonomously (blue)
- `HITL` — Requires human-in-the-loop (yellow)

## First Test Run — Issue #2

Created issue [#2: Star button UI doesn't update until page refresh](https://github.com/jimburch/magpie/issues/2) as a test. Dispatched successfully. The worker completed its work and pushed to `claude/fix-star-button-optimistic-ui-1742342400`, but the PR creation step failed due to a repo permissions setting.

### What was fixed during the test run:
- **Repo setting**: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" needed to be enabled in repo Settings > Actions
- **Push conflict**: Worker (Claude Code) pushed the branch during execution, then the explicit push step in the workflow tried to push again and got a non-fast-forward rejection. Fixed by changing to `git push --force-with-lease`.

### Still pending from test run:
- The branch `claude/fix-star-button-optimistic-ui-1742342400` exists with a commit but no PR was created. Need to either create the PR manually from the existing branch or delete the branch and re-dispatch.

## Known Issues & Things to Figure Out

### 1. Worker push duplication
Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` may push the branch itself during execution (if it decides to). Then the workflow's explicit "Push branch" step tries to push again. We added `--force-with-lease` as a band-aid, but we should investigate whether Claude Code is pushing and if so, whether the explicit push step is even needed, or if the worker prompt should instruct Claude not to push.

### 2. Worker prompt may need iteration
The worker prompt is a first draft. After reviewing actual PR output from real runs, we'll likely need to tune:
- How much exploration vs. implementation time the worker spends
- Whether the quality gate instructions are clear enough
- Whether the PR metadata XML tags are reliably generated
- How the worker handles failures (blocked by missing deps, unclear requirements, etc.)

### 3. Dispatch prompt tuning
The dispatcher needs real-world testing with multiple issues to validate:
- Dependency graph parsing works correctly with the issue template format
- Conflict detection between issues that touch the same files
- Priority ordering matches expectations
- Edge cases: issues with no labels, issues with partial template fields

### 4. No HITL script yet
We discussed building both HITL (`ralph-once.sh`) and AFK (`ralph.sh` / dispatch) modes. Only the dispatcher/worker (AFK) mode was built. A local HITL script for watching Ralph work on a single issue interactively was not implemented. This could be useful for:
- Debugging worker behavior
- Working on architectural/risky issues locally before promoting to AFK
- Testing prompt changes without burning CI minutes

### 5. E2E tests not in quality gates
Unit tests run before commit, but Playwright E2E tests are skipped because they need a running app + database. Options to explore:
- Add a `pnpm build` step to the worker quality gate (catches more issues)
- Set up a test database in CI for E2E (adds complexity)
- Keep E2E as a manual check during PR review (current approach)

### 6. Cost monitoring
No cost tracking or budget caps are in place. Each worker run uses Opus in CI which can be expensive. Consider:
- Adding iteration/token limits to worker runs
- Tracking spend per issue/dispatch
- Setting up alerts for runaway workers (the 30-min timeout helps but isn't a cost cap)

### 7. Notification system
No notifications when workers complete or fail. Matt Pocock uses `tt notify` for completion alerts. Options:
- GitHub Actions notifications (default, but noisy)
- Slack/Discord webhook on workflow completion
- Email summary of dispatch results

### 8. Stale branch cleanup
If workers fail or PRs are abandoned, `claude/*` branches accumulate. No automated cleanup exists. Consider:
- A scheduled workflow to delete merged/stale `claude/*` branches
- Manual cleanup as part of triage

### 9. Dispatch doesn't validate workflow exists
If `claude-work.yml` is missing or misconfigured, dispatch will fail at the `gh workflow run` step with a cryptic error. Could add a pre-flight check.

### 10. Issue template vs. skill-generated issues
The GitHub Issue Template enforces structure for manual issue creation, but skills creating issues programmatically (via `gh issue create`) need to follow the same format. No validation exists to ensure skill-generated issues have the right sections. Consider documenting the expected format for skills or adding a shared schema.

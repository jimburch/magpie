# MVP Plan — 4-6 Week Build

## Guiding Principles

- Ship the smallest thing that demonstrates the core value: share → discover → clone
- Don't build features nobody has asked for yet
- Prioritize the CLI clone experience — that's the magic moment
- Seed with real setups before launch — an empty platform is a dead platform
- Good enough SSR + SEO on day one beats perfect SSR in month two

## Week 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Project scaffold, database, auth, basic CRUD

### Tasks

- [x] Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS + shadcn-svelte
- [x] Configure Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL connection
- [x] Define database schema (`schema.ts`) for all tables
- [x] Run initial migration
- [x] Add shared types and Zod validation schemas
- [x] Build health check API endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)
- [x] Add consistent API response helpers (`success` / `error`)
- [x] Verify full stack works (dev server + health endpoint + all tests pass)
- [ ] Set up Lucia Auth v3 + Arctic
- [ ] Implement GitHub OAuth flow (web): login + callback routes
- [ ] Create `hooks.server.ts` for session validation
- [ ] Build basic layout: navbar (logo, search bar, login/avatar), footer
- [ ] User profile page (read-only): `(public)/[username]/+page.svelte`
- [ ] Setup CRUD API routes:
  - `POST /api/v1/setups` — create
  - `GET /api/v1/setups/:owner/:slug` — read
  - `PATCH /api/v1/setups/:id` — update
  - `DELETE /api/v1/setups/:id` — delete
- [ ] Setup files API: `GET /api/v1/setups/:id/files`

### Milestone: Can log in with GitHub, create a setup via API, view it at a URL

  - Polling endpoint: `POST /api/v1/auth/device/poll`
  - `magpie login` command
  - `magpie logout` command
- [ ] CLI search:
  - `magpie search <query>` — calls explore API, formats results
  - `magpie trending` — calls trending API
  - `magpie view <owner>/<slug>` — calls setup detail API

### Milestone: Can star/follow/comment on web. CLI can login and search.

---

## Week 4: CLI Clone + Publish

**Goal:** The flagship features — clone a setup from CLI, publish a setup from CLI

### Tasks

- [ ] `magpie clone <owner>/<slug>`:
  - Fetch setup + files from API
  - Resolve target paths (expand `~`, `./`)
  - Conflict detection (check existing files)
  - Interactive prompts: overwrite / skip / backup / diff
  - Write files to disk
  - Post-install command execution (with confirmation)
  - Clone event recording (API call)
  - `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--pick` flags
- [ ] `magpie init`:
  - Auto-detect common AI config files in cwd
  - Interactive prompts for name, description, tools, tags
  - File mapping prompts for each detected file
  - Generate `setup.json`

## Explicitly NOT in MVP

These are real features but building them now would blow the timeline:

- **Version history / diffing** — setups have one "current" state
- **Private setups** — everything is public
- **Forking** — users clone and re-publish as their own
- **Notifications** — no email or in-app notifications
- **Teams / orgs** — individual accounts only
- **Git integration** — no push/pull workflow, just publish via CLI or web
- **VS Code / Cursor extension** — CLI only
- **AI recommendations** — simple trending + search is enough
- **Analytics dashboard** — just counts on the setup page
- **Import from GitHub** — manual creation only
- **Setup composition** — can't merge multiple setups
- **Comments editing/deletion** — create-only for MVP
- **Email/password auth** — GitHub OAuth only
